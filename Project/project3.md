# Unit 3 Project: "LISTMATE" cooking ingredients record app

## Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition
Kai Eduardo Suzuki is a G11 student at UWC ISAK Japan. He cooks a lot, but finds it difficult to keep track of all the ingredients he has. This is because he loses track of where each ingredient is kept in his fridge and in his room. Also, he cannot keep track of the expiry dates of all the ingredients, so sometimes he finds himself not being able to eat them anymore. Therefore, I would like to create an application on my computer that allows me to keep track of where each ingredient is stored and when its expiry date is. The application also needs a login system, as several people may use this application and we want to keep track of progress accordingly.

## Proposed Solution
Considering the client's requirements, a suitable solution would include a localised computer programme with a graphical user interface (GUI) that can store data in a database. The database is SQLite, an embedded serverless relational database, so both the programme and the database can be localised.ORM is a database abstraction layer that intervenes between the code and the database engine simplifies queries and makes the code more concise; for the GUI, we use KivyMD, which is elegant and simple. This GUI framework is structured in an object-oriented format to facilitate development.



**Problem:** He has limited budget to buy the device that can measure the temperture and humidity.
