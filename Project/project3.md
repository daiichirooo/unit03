## Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition
**Client:** The student of UWC ISAK Japan

**Context:** The client is a student of UWC ISAK Japan and he is currently suffering from difference in the temperature and humidity insides his room compared to the outer space in the ISAK campus. His room is too hot and dry compared to outside which is too cold and humid. And he want to have a device that would let him measure the temperture and humidity in the room, to compare to the areas outside his room, and see how he can sort out a way to adjust his room's condition to fit with the campus condition.


**Problem:** He has limited budget to buy the device that can measure the temperture and humidity.
